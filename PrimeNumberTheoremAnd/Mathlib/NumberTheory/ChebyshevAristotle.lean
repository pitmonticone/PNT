# Chebyshev functions

This file defines the Chebyshev functions `theta` and `psi`.
These give logarithmically weighted sums of primes and prime powers.

## Main definitions

- `Chebyshev.psi` gives the sum of `ArithmeticFunction.vonMangoldt`
- `Chebyshev.theta` gives the sum of `log p` over primes

## Main results

- `Chebyshev.theta_eq_log_primorial` shows that `θ x` is the log of the product of primes up to x
- `Chebyshev.theta_le_log4_mul_x` gives Chebyshev's upper bound on `θ`
- `Chebyshev.psi_eq_sum_theta` and `Chebyshev.psi_eq_theta_add_sum_theta` relate `psi` to `theta`.
- `Chevyshev.psi_le_const_mul_self` gives Chebyshev's upper bound on `ψ`.

## Notation

We introduce the scoped notations `θ` and `ψ` in the Chebyshev namespace for the Chebyshev
functions.

## References

Parts of this file were upstreamed from the PrimeNumberTheoremAnd project by Kontorovich et al, https://github.com/alexKontorovich/PrimeNumberTheoremAnd.

## TODOS

- Upstream the results relating `theta` and `psi` to the prime counting function.
- Prove Chebyshev's lower bound.

## Relating `ψ` and `θ`

We isolate the contributions of different prime powers to `ψ` and use this to show that `ψ` and `θ`
are close.
