# Uniform Asymptotics

For a family of functions `f : ι × α → E` and `g : α → E`, we can think of
`f =O[𝓟 s ×ˢ l] fun (i, x) ↦ g x` as expressing that `f i` is O(g) uniformly on `s`.

This file provides methods for constructing `=O[𝓟 s ×ˢ l]` relations (similarly `Θ`)
and deriving their consequences.
